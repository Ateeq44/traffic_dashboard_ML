<h1>Traffic &amp; Road Safety Dashboard</h1>
  <p>
    The Traffic &amp; Road Safety Dashboard is an interactive Streamlit application designed to help city planners, students and researchers
    explore risky road segments within major Pakistani cities. The dashboard highlights roads with the highest accident risk based on a
    risk score and allows you to filter by city, view the roads on a map and examine summary statistics. This project can serve as a
    foundation for data‑driven road safety research or for educational demonstrations of simple AI/ML applications.

  <p> The dashboard does not persist a trained model; instead it simply visualises a risk score provided in the dataset. You can
  replace the sample data with your own road safety dataset generated by a machine‑learning model.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>City selector</strong> – Use the sidebar drop‑down to choose between Karachi, Lahore or Sargodha (or any other cities present in your dataset). The dashboard updates dynamically for the selected city.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive map</strong> – Shows each road segment as a circle on a map using Folium. Circles are coloured red for <em>High</em>, orange for <em>Medium</em> and green for <em>Low</em> risk based on the <code>risk_score</code> column.</li>
    <li><strong>Top 10 risky roads table</strong> – Lists the ten roads with the highest risk score in the selected city alongside their scores (as percentages).</li>
    <li><strong>Risk category tabs</strong> – Separate tabs for High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk display only the roads within each category with their names and scores.</li>
    <li><strong>Trend chart</strong> – A simulated seven‑day trend of the number of high‑risk roads. This can be replaced with real time‑series data if available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Python 3</strong> – Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.</li>
    <li><strong>Install dependencies</strong> – Run the following command (preferably inside a virtual environment) to install required packages:
      <pre><code>python -m pip install streamlit pandas numpy folium streamlit-folium matplotlib</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Running the Dashboard</h2>
  <p>After installing the dependencies and placing <code>traffic_dashboard.py</code> and <code>roads_data.csv</code> in the same directory, run:</p>
  <pre><code>python -m streamlit run traffic_dashboard.py</code></pre>
  <p>Streamlit will start a local server and print a URL (usually <code>http://localhost:8501</code>). Open this URL in your web browser to use the dashboard. From the sidebar, select a city to visualise its high‑risk road segments, review the top 10 dangerous roads and explore risk categories.</p>

  <h2>Customising the Dataset</h2>
  <p>The dashboard reads from <code>roads_data.csv</code>. To use your own data:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a CSV file with <strong>at least</strong> the following columns:
      <ul>
        <li><code>city</code> – Name of the city (e.g. Karachi, Lahore).</li>
        <li><code>road_name</code> – Name or description of the road segment.</li>
        <li><code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> – Coordinates in decimal degrees.</li>
        <li><code>risk_score</code> – A numeric risk score between 0 and 1. Scores ≥ 0.7 are considered High risk, 0.3–0.7 Medium risk and ≤ 0.3 Low risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Place the file in the same directory as <code>traffic_dashboard.py</code> and rename it to <code>roads_data.csv</code> (or adjust the code to read your file).</li>
    <li>Restart the dashboard. The new data will be loaded automatically and the map, table and summary statistics will update.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Extending the Model</h2>
  <p>The sample dataset uses random risk scores for demonstration. For a true AI/ML solution, you might:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Collect accident data, traffic volume and infrastructure features for each road segment.</li>
    <li>Engineer features such as accident frequency, time of day, road width, visibility and weather.</li>
    <li>Train a model (e.g. gradient boosting, random forest) to predict accident risk. Output a risk probability between 0 and 1 for each road.</li>
    <li>Export the predictions as <code>risk_score</code> in your dataset and load them into this dashboard.</li>
  </ol>
